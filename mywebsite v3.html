	<H2> Where did I catch the bug? </H2>
	<p> In 2010 I wanted raise money for Penny Appeal to build a well in Pakistan. I set about planning to run a marathon and took the first step towards this by taking part in the Bristol 10k run race. There were of course two important things to consider:
	<OL TYPE=“i” START=“3”>
<OL id "one"> The Training </OL>
<P> I've always been quite the active type, having a young daughter I am always kept on my feet running around.
The training was of course going to require a slighty different strategy. I opted to plan 2 to 3 times a week 
fortunatly in Bristol we have some great running spots amoung my favorites is the Durham Downs.</P>

	<H3> The Half Marathons </H3>
	<p> In 2012, I ran my first and succesful attempt at a half marathon again in the hometown of Bristol. I remember the nervouness of stand at the start wondering if I would finish, could I really get to 13.1 mile. I remember breifly asking myself <q> Why am I doing this to myself </q>
	just under 2 hours later I found the answer when I croosed the finish line. I somehow still have </P>
		
	<H4> The Marathons</H4>
	<p> I started my Marathon journey by running one of these wordls most highly recognised events, The the Virgin London Marathon. The event was fantatsic, i'll never get the support of the fans, the heat of the day or
	the euphoria of crossing Londons Tower bridge where it felt everyone was cheering out my name. I also rememebr the postive affirmation that really inspired me to dig deep and find the last few miles. Quotes like

  <H1>Stop yourself overtraining</H1>
  

<p>Fail to spot the signs and it could take months to recover from overtraining  get to know the signs and the repurcussions that could follow. <p>

<h2> How to spot it </h2>
<p>When preparing for a challenge, it is tempting to ramp up training, but overdoing things can detrimentally affect performance and health. Fatigue is the most common symptom and is associated with irritability, low mood, poor sleep, appetite loss, lack of enthusiasm and a drop-off in performance. Signs of overtraining include a raised resting heart rate, increased susceptibility to infections, muscle soreness and weight loss. </p>

<H3> What causes it? </h3>
<p>Athletes with overtraining syndrome have increased cortisol levels  the bodies stress hormone. In men, there is a decrease in testosterone, which reduces the ability to build muscle. In women, oestrogen levels fall, causing periods to stop. Overall, the body has a decreased ability to repair itself during rest. Continuing to train hard only worsens the situation. Psychological effects include sleep disturbance and can lead to depression, anxiety, loss of self-confidence and eating disorders. </p>

<h4> What to do about it </h4>
<p>As with most things, prevention is better than cure. Increases in training should be done gradually, with periods of rest built in. If you recognise overtraining early (after three to four weeks), a three to five day rest is usually sufficient. After that, resume training at the usual intensity  but only on alternate days for a few weeks  before gradually increasing total volume. In more severe cases, you may have to stop training for weeks, and it may take months to recover. An underlying illness may be to blame if so, medical help may be needed.</p>

never stop running
never stop moving forward
even if your friends leave you
helpless and alone
even if you have no place
you can call home
never stop running
your race to success
or wherever you are going
because your race
makes you shine 
and keeps you glowing

never stop running
never stop moving forward
even when you suffer a loss
leaving you crying sad
even when you make a mistake
leaving you insanely mad
never stop running
your race to satisfaction
or wherever you may venture
because your race
is a triumphant adventure
that keeps you glowing

never stop running
never stop moving forward
even when you lose your energy
leaving you so very tired
even when you lose your will
to keep running the course
NEVER stop running! 
your race to the finish
your race to completion
because your race
is what keeps you going
your race keeps you glowing 

Never Stop Running!
